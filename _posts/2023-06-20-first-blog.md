Finally, I've decided to start a [Fuji X Weekly](https://fujixweekly.com) challenge with my new Fujifilm XT-5 camera, which I bought it back in December last year. I started taking photos using Cannon EOS 500D when I was 13 yo. I could still remember how I begged my parents, convincing them to get a new camera for me (It was worth it for a thousand reasons!). I later moved to portable iPhones in 2013, because they are really convenient on the go. Just looking at the Photos app on my phone - it's been 10 years (!) with about 40k photos and 600 videos. 

However I did notice a gradual decrease in the number of photos I take in recent years, so does the appreciation of those beautiful moments through the lens.

Now, in an attempt to return to my photography "prelife",
my current plan is to pick a fuji weekly recipe and take as many shots as I can during the week. Then select the **3** best ones and put them [here](../photo.md).

Let's see how that goes ...
