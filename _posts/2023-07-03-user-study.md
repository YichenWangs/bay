title:  "OPEN CALL: Recruiting Electronic Music Artists/Musicians for My AR Digital Music Ensemble Project"

Hello there!

I'm seeking musicians or artists based in Canberra to participate in my a formal AR user study.

The aim of this project is to explore how AR can enhance a musician's awareness and engagement in a digital music ensemble.

The proposed study will be approximately 90 minutes and will include **four** improvisation sessions, each lasting between 10-15 minutes. You'll be paired with another musician or artist to test musical collaboration under an AR interface + a provided electronic music instrument, with the sessions employing varying experimental conditions: Bodily Interaction versus Musical Interface Information.

This work is directly inspired [my own experiences in ensemble improvisation](../../../work) using my AR instrument, *isometric-sen*. 

Please sign up [here](https://forms.gle/FEyhopHTKMLgQ1TTA) or directly email me at [yichen.wang@anu.edu.au](mailto:yichen.wang@anu.edu.au) for more info.
