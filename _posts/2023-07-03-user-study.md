title:  "OPEN CALL: Recruiting Electronic Music Artists/Musicians for My AR Digital Music Ensemble Project"

Hello there!

I'm recruiting musicians or artists (based in Canberra) who are interested in participating in my AR project.


The project aims to investigate how augmented reality (AR) supports musical performersâ€™ awareness and engagement in a digital music ensemble. 

This proposed study is a 90 minutes which includes *four* 10-15 mins improvisation sessions (paired with another musician/artist) to test musical collaboration under an AR interface with different experimental conditions (Bodily Interaction versus Musical Interface Information).

This work is directly inspired my own [experiences in ensemble improvisation](../work.md) using my AR instrument *isometric-sen*.
