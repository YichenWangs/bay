My work explores the design and development of spatial musical interfaces in augmented reality, transitioning from the concept of "mapping" as a metaphor in digital musical instrument design to the more recent theory of "[entanglement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642171)" for [musical interaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642171). This theory addresses the deep relationship between humans and digital technology, highlight how new systems reconfigure associative networks to shape musical experiences. This poster presents three projects that illustrate a progressive artistic and experimental exploration of spatial musical interfaces in augmented/mixed reality (AR/MR). These projects span experiences as a first-person musician _[cube](./cube.md)_, collaborations with other musicians _[armIDI](./collab-ar.md)_, and co-creation with an intelligent agent _[off the shelf](./embodied-ai-ar.md)_. Together, they demonstrate the evolving interplay between human and digital elements in musical interaction and how AR can shape novel audio experiences.
