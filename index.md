I'm Yichen (逸宸), a PhD researcher who works at the intersection of musical creativity and computer science. 
My research encompasses [new interface for musical expression](https://www.nime.org), augmented reality and the entangled nature of digital music ensemble in Human-Computer Interaction. 

My recent research works include: mixed reality musical instrument [_cube_](works), networked augmented reality collaborative expression for digital musical ensemble, with [creative practices](performances) along the way.
