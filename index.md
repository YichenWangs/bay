  Hi there - <br>
  I'm Yichen, a final-year computer science student with broad interests in visual arts, creative computing and philosophy. This website is a portfolio of my exploration between computing and arts during past few years study at School of Computing, Australian National University. I'm always excited about life and wondered how to make the best use of my knowledge in computing to make contributions to this world. You can checkout some of my projects, or cool things that I experiment in my spare time. <br>
  Please feel free to explore this website and contact me if you have any comment or question.
