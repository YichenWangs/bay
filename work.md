    description: Sonic Sculptural Staircase is a head-mounted augmented reality (HMAR) sound artwork that integrates sound, visual overlay and interaction to enhance the appreciation of a sculptural staircase and its surroundings. The work designed ten different interactive sonic features that mainly exploits sound as the main information channel to prompt the userâ€™s engagement and convey the meaning behind the staircase.
