    description: Sonic Sculptural Staircase is a head-mounted augmented reality (HMAR) sound artwork that integrates sound, visual overlay and interaction to enhance the appreciation of a sculptural staircase and its surroundings. The work designed ten different interactive sonic features that mainly exploits sound as the main information channel to prompt the userâ€™s engagement and convey the meaning behind the staircase.

    description: Finally - our Laptop Ensemble performance is up online (mine starts at 56:56)! "Sunset Inspo" is a creative living coding artwork that uses Extempore and P5.js to present a real-time audiovisual performance. The theme of the work came from my experiences of watching sunset at Canberra (a tiny but lovely city)!
