is a mixed reality musical instrument designed to explore what is a genuine musical interface in head-mounted augmented reality (AR) system, and how this technology mediates the musical experiences between musicians and their tools.

The interface is composed of tonal cubes arranged in a 3D spiral shape, played through freehand gestures to activate tonal drone synthesis. Musicians can play a combination of cubes for chords or focus on individual ones for tonal experience with poly-synthesised texture. With a flexibility of spatial placement, this allows the musician to become immersed within the super-size shape in audio experiences.

## [-] Design and Development

The instrument was developed using [autobiographical design](https://doi.org/10.1145/3492342), incorporating recent advancements in freehand interaction, a self-contained synthesis mechanism, and aesthetics of musical expression.

The interface was programmed in `Unity` with [`Microsoft MRTK`](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit), with audio implemented in `C#` through the `[DisunityST](https://github.com/digego/DisunityST)` toolkit for real-time synthesis.

- A [follow-up paper](https://zenodo.org/records/11189129) from NIME'23 presents a user study with 20 musicians on their musical experiences with the **tangibility of spatial interaction** and **mobility**.

We have performed with the CUBE instrument in various setups, and you can watch some of these performances here:
- [beyond realms.](https://youtu.be/5QUpw_7yZqU?si=2zG3zBatRQoHtkLE) with Sandy Ma at ACMC'23.
